BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* column settings not saving!

* sorting on column like "genre" is VERY SLOW

* edit comments on multiple files at once -- comments don't show up in table

* album sort order -- screwed up for compilations -- should be album / disc / track; forget about
  artist (unless we can do album artist); this will have a side effect of mixing up
  lists of albums like "The Very Best Of" by different artists, but this is less of
  a problem than the common case of compilation albums

* if disc or track number is 0, show it as empty in the table

* should probably have a map of all columns to indices so we don't have to constantly
  fix things in 5 places when we modify the code that sets up and fills the columns

- filter for a genre, e.g. "Traditional".  Select all, change genre.  Save;
  genres are changed, but software throws exception when trying to load
  a now-empty list.  Actually, it seems that if *any* of the songs are
  now ineligible for the filtered results, you get an exception.

- can't move a playlist to a folder that is scrolled offscreen
