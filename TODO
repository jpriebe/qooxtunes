BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- if nothing is in the queue, the popup comes up, but it's completely empty; would
  be better to have it say "nothing queued"

- select a playlist, table reloads, but row count doesn't update, and scrollbar doesn't
appear automatically

- run search, choose type of search (e.g. "Artist"), run new search, the new search
  will ignore your dropdown selection

- can't move a playlist to a folder that is scrolled offscreen
