    - filter for album

 - allow dragging tracks from playlist table onto a playlist to add tracks from one playlist to another

   stream of network requests makes it hard to debug)

 - BUGFIX: search with mixed case -- no results

 - BUGFIX: search for a term, scroll down the page, then type a new search; y scroll bar should reset to 0

 - BUGFIX: editing sequential tracks -- if you change a field that alters the sort order
           of the song, the "prev" and "next" buttons will give unexpected results

 - BUGFIX: select a playlist, table reloads, but row count doesn't update, and scrollbar doesn't resize

 - BUGFIX: sorting on genre was slow

 - BUGFIX: if editing songs with a search filter active, if the edits make the song ineligible
   for the filter, an exception is thrown.
